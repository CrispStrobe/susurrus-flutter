## 0. CrispASR 0.6.x parity sweep (May 2026) — ✅ shipped in v0.4.1

Six rounds of work between May 2026 brought CrisperWeaver up to
CrispASR 0.6.2 parity: 3 new screens (Translate, Voice Bake, Local
HTTP server), 8 new backends in the catalog, runtime-tunable
flash-attn / GPU layers / TTS sampling sliders, and 3 new export
formats. Released as
[v0.4.1](https://github.com/CrispStrobe/CrisperWeaver/releases/tag/v0.4.1)
paired with
[CrispASR v0.6.2](https://github.com/CrispStrobe/CrispASR/releases/tag/v0.6.2).

Full per-round write-up: **[HISTORY.md → "May 2026 parity sweep"](HISTORY.md)**.

**Still deferred** (each tracked upstream in `../CrispASR/PLAN.md`):

* **Wiring `flash_attn` into every backend's compute graph** — the
  toggle ships in the open-params struct (round 5) and threads
  through to each backend's session via the per-backend `flash_attn`
  field on context_params (round 6, closing CrispASR #89). Only
  whisper consumes it at the kernel level today. Tracked as
  **[CrispASR PLAN.md #86](https://github.com/CrispStrobe/CrispASR/blob/main/PLAN.md#86-per-backend-flash-attention-wiring-crisperweaver-driven)**
  — full per-backend status table, recipe, and recommended order
  (orpheus + chatterbox-T3 first; ~2–3 focused days for the full
  sweep).
* **`gpu_backend` selector** (metal / cuda / vulkan / cpu-only as a
  runtime string) — needs ggml-side multi-backend dispatch first.
  Tracked as
  **[CrispASR PLAN.md #87](https://github.com/CrispStrobe/CrispASR/blob/main/PLAN.md#87-gpu_backend-runtime-selector-multi-backend-ggml-build)**.

The OpenAI-compatible server item that was previously deferred is
SHIPPED as a Dart-side `shelf` server in round 5 (see HISTORY +
the §7 note below). The CrispASR-side `crispasr --server` binary
remains available as the desktop-only alternative.

## 1. Engine status

Two engines behind the `TranscriptionEngine` interface (`lib/engines/transcription_engine.dart`):

| Engine            | State                                                                      |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CrispASREngine`  | ✅ Primary. Dart FFI to `libcrispasr` / `libwhisper`. Dispatches across all 10 backends via `CrispasrSession`. |
| `MockEngine`      | ✅ Deterministic fake responses — used for UI work and CI.                 |

Earlier prototypes had separate `WhisperCppEngine` and `CoreMLEngine` values (method-channel wrappers). Dropped: whisper.cpp ships inside CrispASR, and CoreML acceleration will land as an opt-in inside libwhisper (`WHISPER_USE_COREML`) rather than a separate engine. `EngineType.sherpaOnnx` was dropped earlier for being a placeholder.

## 2. Model-family status

All 10 CrispASR backends are runtime-ready through `CrispasrSession`. The bundled `libcrispasr` must be linked with each backend's shared library; `CrispasrSession.availableBackends()` reports live at startup which ones this build has.

| Family               | Download | Runtime FFI                      | Notes                                    |

| Parakeet             | ✅       | ✅ via `CrispasrSession`          | Fast English ASR, native word timestamps  |

| Kyutai STT 1B        | ✅       | ✅ via `CrispasrSession`          | Streaming-style STT                        |
| GLM-ASR Nano         | ✅       | ✅ via `CrispasrSession`          | GLM-family multilingual                    |
| VibeVoice ASR        | ✅       | ✅ via `CrispasrSession`          | Large multilingual (~4.5 GB)               |
| MiMo ASR             | ✅       | ✅ via `CrispasrSession`          | XiaomiMiMo MiMo-Audio                      |

The same unified dispatcher is shared with the Python (`crispasr.Session`) and Rust (`crispasr::Session`) wrappers — one C-ABI, three languages.

## 3. Platform status

| Platform | State | Blocker                                                                                      |
| -------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| macOS    | ✅    | None. `flutter build macos` + `scripts/bundle_macos_dylibs.sh` produces a runnable `.app`.   |
| Linux    | ✅    | None. CI `build-linux` job bundles all `.so`'s; local build needs a Linux host.              |
| Windows  | ✅    | Released via `release.yml`; `.zip` with `whisper.dll` + sibling backend DLLs produced on every tag. Still `continue-on-error` until a user confirms the runtime works on a real Windows machine. |
| Android  | ⚠️    | KTS gradle only (Groovy + legacy CMakeLists removed). APK builds with Mock engine out of the box; real ASR needs `libwhisper.so` cross-built via `CrispASR/build-android.sh` and dropped into `android/app/src/main/jniLibs/<abi>/`. That wiring isn't automated in CI. |
| iOS      | ⚠️    | Podfile rewritten to a clean minimal Flutter template. `pod install` should now succeed, but hasn't been CI-verified; the Xcode project still contains a Runner-Bridging-Header.h reference that's now a no-op. |

## 4. Feature status

| Feature                                    | State                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Model download + resume + cancel + delete  | ✅                                                                    |
| Quantised variants (q4_0 / q5_0 / q8_0)    | ✅ from `cstr/whisper-ggml-quants`                                    |
| Checksum skip toggle                       | ✅ in *Settings → Debugging*                                           |
| History (persisted)                        | ✅ `<app-docs>/history/*.json`                                         |
| Exports (TXT / SRT / VTT / JSON)           | ✅ via share sheet                                                    |
| Performance readout (RTF, WPS)             | ✅                                                                    |

| Inbound share (audio → app)                | ✅ Android intent filters, iOS doc types, macOS UTI open-in           |
| Desktop drag-and-drop                      | ✅ `desktop_drop` on transcription screen                             |
| Audio decoding (WAV / MP3 / FLAC)          | ✅ `crispasr_audio_load` FFI via miniaudio — no ffmpeg dep            |
| Word-level timestamps (Whisper)            | ✅ via CrispASR 0.2.0                                                 |
| Language auto-detect (Whisper)             | ✅ via CrispASR 0.2.0 `crispasr_detect_language`                      |
| VAD (Silero) — end to end                  | ✅ shipped in v0.1.7 via CrispASR 0.4.4 `crispasr_session_transcribe_vad`; single Advanced Options toggle, Silero GGUF bundled as asset, whisper + session paths both wired |
| Streaming transcription (Whisper)          | ✅ via CrispASR 0.3.0 `crispasr_stream_*` — 10s window / 3s step       |
| i18n (en + de)                             | ⚠️ Scaffold via `flutter_localizations` + `lib/l10n/*.arb`; main screens migrated, widgets + older Settings strings still hardcoded |
| Real speaker diarization (library API)     | ✅ via CrispASR 0.4.5 `crispasr_diarize_segments_abi` — `lib/services/diarization_service.dart` now calls the shared lib (energy / xcorr / vad-turns / pyannote). MFCC/k-means stopgap removed. |
| Language auto-detect for non-Whisper backends | ✅ via CrispASR 0.4.6 `crispasr_detect_language_pcm` — `LidService` (`lib/services/lid_service.dart`) runs whisper-tiny LID before session backends when the user picks "auto" and any multilingual whisper model is downloaded. |
| Word timestamps for LLM backends           | ✅ via CrispASR 0.4.7 `crispasr_align_words_abi` — `AlignerService` (`lib/services/aligner_service.dart`) runs canary-CTC / qwen3-fa as a post-step for qwen3 / voxtral / granite when the user has word-timestamps enabled and an aligner GGUF is on disk. |
| Punctuation restoration (FireRedPunc)      | ✅ via CrispASR 0.5.x `PuncModel` — `PuncService` (`lib/services/punc_service.dart`) plus an "Restore punctuation" toggle in Advanced Options. Loads `fireredpunc-*.gguf` lazily; silently no-ops when the model isn't downloaded. |
| Dynamic backend discovery from libcrispasr | ✅ `ModelService.refreshFromCrispasrRegistry()` — calls `CrispasrSession.availableBackends()` + `crispasr.registryLookup` per backend, merges every linked backend's canonical GGUF into the model picker without any CrisperWeaver code change. Runs on every Model Management screen open. |

## 5. Open roadmap items

Earlier §5.1–§5.7, §5.11–§5.21, §5.23, and most of §5.8 are
shipped — see [HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md) for full per-section
write-ups. What follows is only the work that's still pending.

### 5.1 Competitor-gap features

Audited against the common feature set of comparable local
GUI tools (whisper-based desktop apps for macOS / Linux /
Windows) plus the cloud meeting-transcription category, in
May 2026. CrisperWeaver already does most of what they do AND
several things they don't (engine breadth, cross-platform, free /
OSS, multilingual UI, text translation, OpenAI-compatible HTTP
server, parallel batch pool with OOM pre-flight).

Most of §5.1 is shipped — full write-ups in [HISTORY.md → "Post-
v0.4.1 §5.1 competitor-gap sweep — May 2026"](HISTORY.md#post-v041-51-competitor-gap-sweep--may-2026).
Open items only below.

#### Shipped (see HISTORY.md)

- ✅ **5.1.1** System audio capture (macOS / Linux / Windows /
  Android; iOS deliberately unsupported).
- ✅ **5.1.2** Custom vocabulary / dictionary boost.
- ✅ **5.1.3** Inline transcript editing + history persistence.
- ✅ **5.1.4** History search.
- ✅ **5.1.5** Audio waveform editor + bidirectional transcript
  sync (Phases A → D).
- ✅ **5.1.6 v1** Deterministic "Tidy transcript" pass.
- ✅ **5.1.6 v2** BYOK cloud LLM cleanup pass.
- ✅ **5.1.6 v3** Local on-device LLM cleanup + summarisation.
- ✅ **5.1.7** Templates / presets.
- ✅ **5.1.8** Meeting-style summarisation.
- ✅ **5.1.11** Global hotkey for push-to-transcribe.
- ✅ **5.1.12** Voice clone wizard.

#### Open items

* ~~**LID picker — Firered / Ecapa methods**~~ —
  **shipped May 2026**. Upstream CrispASR 0.5.8 extended
  `LidMethod` to all four methods; CrisperWeaver's Advanced
  Options picker now offers all four, the model registry has
  catalogue entries for `firered-lid-f16` + `ecapa-lid-107-f16`,
  and `LidService.methodForFilename` routes by basename.

* ~~**5.1.6 v3.1 Curated chat-model catalogue**~~ —
  **shipped May 2026**. 5 entries spanning small/medium/large
  buckets + ≥ 2 families (SmolLM2-360M, Qwen2.5-0.5B,
  Llama-3.2-1B, Qwen2.5-3B, Llama-3.2-3B — all Q4_K_M via
  bartowski/* HF repos). Settings → Local LLM gets a
  "Suggested chat models" picker; Model Management gets a
  Chat-LLM filter chip. Recommended `nCtx` / `nGpuLayers`
  values live in the model description text — users tune via
  the existing Advanced section sliders.

* ~~**Responsive UI — phone sub-screens for Settings dialogs**~~
  — **shipped May 2026**. The Cloud LLM / Local LLM / Hotkey
  dialogs now route to dedicated sub-screens
  (`/settings/cloud-llm` / `/settings/local-llm` /
  `/settings/hotkey`) on phone-width viewports, sharing the
  same form-widget body with the wide-layout dialogs. See
  CHANGELOG → "Responsive UI — Settings sub-screens on mobile".

* **Platform-native share / receive — remaining tail** — the
  May 2026 pass shipped tiered transcript shares (MD + audio
  bundle), multi-file inbound enqueue, transcript-file intake
  (.srt / .vtt), Linux `.desktop` integration with argv intake,
  and iOS Share Extension *template files* + setup doc. What's
  still pending:

  - **iOS Share Extension target wiring** — the Swift / plist /
    entitlements files are checked in under
    `ios/ShareExtension/`; the one-time Xcode target creation
    + App Group capability + scheme wiring is described in
    `docs/ios-share-extension-setup.md`. Run that once on a
    dev machine to land the extension; no further code changes
    needed.
  - ~~**macOS Open-With handler**~~ — **shipped May 2026**.
    `OpenWithReceiver.swift` + Dart-side `DesktopOpenWithBridge`
    feed Finder's Open With / `open foo.wav` from the terminal
    / dock-drop into `ShareIntakeService.acceptPaths`.
  - ~~**macOS NSServices**~~ — **shipped May 2026**. Right-click
    a file in Finder → Services → "Transcribe with
    CrisperWeaver" routes the file URLs through the same
    OpenWithReceiver buffer as Open-With. Info.plist
    NSServices entry + `AppDelegate.transcribeAudio(_:userData:error:)`
    + `NSApp.servicesProvider = self` in
    `applicationDidFinishLaunching`.
  - **Windows file association** — best done at install time
    via an MSIX manifest (`uap:Extension Category=
    "windows.fileTypeAssociation"`). Out of scope until an
    MSIX packaging step exists.

* **5.1.9 Subtitle burning into video** — User selects a video
  file + transcript, gets a video with hardcoded subs. FFmpeg
  subprocess. ~1 day desktop-only. Misaligned with the
  cross-platform "no FFmpeg on the editing path" line we've
  held everywhere else — would need a Dart-side ffmpeg-kit
  wrapper or a pure-Dart muxer to fit. Deferred until either
  exists.

* ~~**5.8.1 Named speaker recognition (TitaNet + SpeakerDB)**~~ —
  **shipped May 2026**. See
  [HISTORY.md → "§5.8.1 Named speaker recognition"](HISTORY.md)
  for the full write-up.

* ~~**5.1.10 Audio enhancement before transcribe**~~ —
  **shipped May 2026 (CrispASR 0.5.12 + CrisperWeaver)**.
  RNNoise (xiph/rnnoise v0.1, BSD-3, ~425 KB GRU weights
  embedded in the binary) vendored under `CrispASR/src/rnnoise/`
  alongside grammar-parser; new C-ABI
  `crispasr_enhance_audio_rnnoise(in, n, out, out_cap)`
  upsamples 16 kHz → 48 kHz via miniaudio's resampler, runs
  RNNoise's 480-sample frame loop, downsamples back. State
  is per-call so worker isolates run concurrently with no
  coordination. Dart `enhanceAudioRnnoise(pcm)` wraps the
  ABI; pre-0.5.12 dylibs raise UnsupportedError so callers
  graceful-degrade. CrisperWeaver: one switch in Advanced
  Options ("Enhance audio (noise reduction)"), backend-
  agnostic, runs before the §5.8 window slice in both the
  single-file path (`TranscriptionService.transcribeFile`)
  and the parallel-pool dispatch (`_runJobOnPool`). Preset
  round-trip pinned; live test (slow-tagged) asserts ≥20%
  RMS drop on synthetic AWGN PCM.

  Dereverberation is still deferred — RNNoise covers the
  HVAC / fan / keyboard background-noise case, which is the
  common one; reverb removal needs a different model class
  (Demucs / WPE) at ~50–100× the compute. Revisit if user
  feedback flags reverb-heavy recordings.

#### Tier D — skip / wait for demand

* Cloud sync (high effort, splits the privacy story)
* Web UI on top of the HTTP server (desktop app covers this
  audience already)
* Final Cut / Premiere XML export (real niche)
* Voice commands during recording (low value vs. UX complexity)

### 5.8 Advanced-Options leftovers

Most of §5.8 is shipped — see [HISTORY.md → "Advanced Options
completeness — May 2026"](HISTORY.md). What's still pending:

* ~~**GBNF (grammar-constrained sampling)**~~ —
  **shipped May 2026 (CrispASR 0.5.9 + CrisperWeaver)**. All
  six steps landed:
  1. `grammar-parser.{h,cpp}` promoted to `CrispASR/src/`.
  2. C ABI `crispasr_session_set_grammar_text` added with
     parse + symbol-resolution + session-level storage.
  3. wparams.grammar_rules / n_grammar_rules / i_start_rule /
     grammar_penalty wired into the whisper transcribe path.
  4. Dart `CrispasrSession.setGrammar(text, rootRule:,
     penalty:)` + `clearGrammar()` with UnsupportedError /
     ArgumentError mapping.
  5. CrisperWeaver Advanced Options: ExpansionTile with the
     multi-line GBNF TextField + root-rule field + penalty
     slider; Whisper-only gating; wired through both the
     worker pool path AND the engine-direct path.
  6. Tests: upstream Dart smoke (parse / re-set / clear /
     invalid / unknown-root, 3/3 green against real
     libcrispasr + ggml-tiny.en.bin) plus a preset round-trip
     case in CrisperWeaver.

* **CrispASR CLI features missing from CrisperWeaver** — found
  during the §5.23 beam-search audit, listed here so the next
  parity pass doesn't have to rediscover them:
  - ✅ `--offset-t` / `--duration` — **shipped May 2026**.
    Two AdvancedOptions fields + UI in the widget; the screen +
    service layer slices the PCM and shifts segment timestamps
    back to absolute file time via the existing
    `shiftSegmentForResume` helper. New static
    `CrispASREngine.sliceTranscribeWindow` handles the
    sample-rate-aware slice math. 10 unit tests pin the edge
    cases.
  - ✅ `--alt N` / `--alt-n` — alternative-candidate tokens —
    **shipped May 2026 (CrispASR 0.5.13 + CrisperWeaver)**. Full
    write-up in [HISTORY.md → "§5.8 Whisper alt-token capture
    (`--alt N`)"](HISTORY.md). Four-layer landing: whisper
    internals capture top-N runners-up on each greedy step into
    a parallel `alts` vector on the segment; C-ABI exposes both
    low-level token accessors and per-word session-result
    accessors; Dart binding surfaces them as `Word.alts` (with
    a new `AltToken` value class) and a sticky
    `CrispasrSession.setAltN(int)`; CrisperWeaver wires `altN`
    through AdvancedOptions / preset round-trip / worker pool
    and renders a tap-to-pick chip row in the segment edit
    dialog. Closes out the §5.8 CLI-parity gap.

    Still-pending follow-ups (low priority — v1 covers the
    common case):
    - **Beam-search alt capture**. Beam siblings are
      beam-conditional, not greedy alternatives, so v1 only
      fires on greedy. A meaningful beam-aware "show the K
      sibling beams' divergence point" UX would need a different
      whisper-side capture path and a different chip shape
      (sibling-walk rather than tap-to-pick). Defer until a
      user actually asks.
    - **Full word-level alt enumeration**. Whisper tokens are
      sub-word BPE, so a multi-token word like "kubectl" →
      `["kub","ect","l"]` only surfaces alts for the first
      content token ("kub" → "cub" / "tu" / …). Computing
      alternative WHOLE words would require a per-word
      token-tree expansion — out of scope for v1; the
      first-token alts cover most real ambiguity in practice.
      Documented in the C-ABI helper comment + the UI help
      string.
    - **Widget test for the alt-picker popover**. The
      transcript-editor edit dialog uses Riverpod providers +
      AppLocalizations, both of which need scaffolding to pump
      headlessly. Unit + preset round-trip tests cover the
      data plumbing; the UI test is a nice-to-have.
    - ~~**Live-tagged end-to-end test**~~ —
      **shipped May 2026** as
      `flutter/crispasr/test/alt_tokens_live_test.dart` on the
      CrispASR side. Real transcription with `altN: 3` against
      `ggml-tiny.en.bin` + `samples/jfk.wav`; asserts ≥1
      returned word has alts, every alt's p ∈ [0, 1] and the
      list is descending by p, chosen token is excluded from
      its own alts, and `setAltN(0)` on a re-decode clears
      them. Tagged `live` so `dart test` without
      `CRISPASR_LIB` + `CRISPASR_MODEL` skips silently. On
      the dev box whisper-tiny produces 22/22 words with
      runner-ups on the JFK clip (representative output:
      "Americans → America(4.85%), americ(3.84%),
      American(3.35%)").
  - ✅ Whisper decoder fallback thresholds (`--entropy-thold`,
    `--logprob-thold`, `--no-speech-thold`, `--temperature-inc`
    / `--no-fallback`) — **shipped May 2026 (CrispASR 0.5.10 +
    CrisperWeaver)**. PLAN's earlier claim that they were "in
    the Dart binding, just not in the UI" was wrong; the C ABI
    + Dart binding + UI all needed adding. `--word-thold` not
    surfaced — its CLI semantics (per-word print filter) don't
    map cleanly to a whisper_full_params field. `--no-fallback`
    is `temperature_inc = 0` (whisper.cpp's actual semantics).
  - ✅ Subtitle line formatting `--max-len` / `--split-on-word`
    (May 2026) — see HISTORY. `--split-on-punct` still pending;
    needs upstream Dart-binding work first.
  - ✅ Token suppression (`--suppress-nst`, `--suppress-regex`)
    and `--carry-initial-prompt` — **shipped May 2026 (CrispASR
    0.5.11 + CrisperWeaver)**. CrispASR's earlier claim that
    these were already in the binding was wrong; both the C-ABI
    setter + Dart wrapper had to be added. UI lives in the
    Advanced Options Whisper-only section as a 3-control
    ExpansionTile (2 switches + 1 regex field). `--print-
    confidence` not surfaced — it's a CLI output-formatting
    flag with no wparams analog.

* **Auto-download default** — CrispASR's `-m auto` per backend.
  *Needs a design pass before becoming a dev task:* model catalog
  has no `isDefault` flag, Model Management is per-quant not
  per-backend, and "smallest functional default" varies wildly
  (whisper-tiny standalone; parakeet has one variant; kokoro
  needs a voicepack; voxtral-q4_k is gigabytes). Three plausible
  shapes — (a) `recommendedDefault: true` flag + "Recommended"
  badge, (b) "Quick start" AppBar bottom-sheet with curated
  combo, (c) per-backend collapsible sections each with a
  "Download default" header button. Pick one before implementing.

### 5.18 Test-suite speed — CoreML for whisper still pending

MTLBinaryArchive pipeline cache shipped (38× cold-start speedup)
— see [HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md).

**Still pending**:

| Win | Projected speedup | Status |
|---|---|---|
| CoreML for whisper on Apple Silicon (`WHISPER_USE_COREML=1` + paired `.mlmodelc`) | Whisper-tiny already 6 s; large-v3 → 2–3× | Deferred to a future CrispASR cycle |
| Re-download q4_k variants for vibevoice / orpheus | vibevoice 17:22 → ~4 min projected; orpheus 11:50 → ~5 min | Blocked on HF availability |

### 5.22 iOS on-device verification — pending

Static audit + xcframework bundling + plist cleanup all shipped
— see [HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md). What's left needs an iPhone:

1. **Mic permission prompt** — First `record.hasPermission()` must
   show the system mic prompt (`NSMicrophoneUsageDescription`
   already set). Verify initial-grant + "denied → Settings →
   toggle on" recovery.
2. **Streaming mic** — `AudioRecorder.startStream` with PCM16 @
   16 kHz is documented as iOS-supported but only the macOS path
   has been exercised. Confirm sub-second chunk cadence + live
   heartbeat.
3. **Recording → playback transitions** — `just_audio` configured
   with `AudioSessionConfiguration.speech()`; needs on-device
   confirmation that switching mic → file → mic is smooth.
4. **Background audio continuation** — `UIBackgroundModes =
   [audio]` declared; verify streaming mic survives screen-lock.
5. **Share intake** — "Open in CrisperWeaver" from Files / Mail
   delivers a path through `receive_sharing_intent`; verify the
   path is readable (security-scoped) and picked up correctly.
6. **`FilePicker.pickFiles`** — UIDocumentPicker copies to temp;
   verify the returned path is openable by `just_audio`.
7. **CoreML companion `.mlmodelc`** — verify
   `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()` is writable for the
   unzip target and that the companion actually loads ("Loading
   Core ML model" in libwhisper logs).
8. **`PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`** — required for App Store Connect
   uploads from May 2024. NSUserDefaults + FileTimestamp APIs
   used; add the manifest before first TestFlight upload.

**Risk:** medium-high. Item 1 (xcframework bundling) was the
only launch-blocker and is done. The rest are quality issues
that surface in use.

**Pre-existing detail on the xcframework bundling +
auto-fix audit:** [HISTORY.md → "iOS feature parity"](HISTORY.md).
### 5.23 Batch transcription — scale-out, parallelism, save/resume

✅ **Shipped May 2026.** All four sub-questions (Q1 foundation,
Q1 grouping + duration probe, Q2 v1 pipeline prefetch, Q2 v2
N-way session pool with OOM pre-flight + worker-protocol
expansion + drain-loop integration, Q3 resume-from-checkpoint,
Q3 polish) shipped end-to-end. Full per-step write-up in
[HISTORY.md → §5.23](HISTORY.md).

**Still pending — small CrispASR-side follow-up:**

* Beam search via session API for granite / voxtral / qwen3 —
  six of eleven beam-capable backends are wired (whisper +
  kyutai-stt / moonshine / omniasr-LLM / glm-asr / firered);
  the remaining three need their per-backend high-level
  transcribe APIs to expose beam_size before
  `crispasr_session_set_beam_size` can plumb through. Their
  beam decode currently lives in CLI wrappers using
  `core_beam_decode::run_with_probs`. ~1–1.5 days total
  across the three families. Tracked as
  [CrispASR PLAN §90](https://github.com/CrispStrobe/CrispASR/blob/main/PLAN.md).

---

### 5.9 Dependency refresh

37 packages have newer versions blocked by constraint overrides (`intl`, `material_color_utilities`, `record_linux`). Revisit after Flutter 3.39 lands: many of the overrides are there to paper over SDK transitions.

### 5.10 Release polish

- Tag-based code signing for macOS + notarization (currently ad-hoc sign only).
- Signed Android APK.
- Windows MSI / EXE installer.

## 6. Adding a new backend

Three-step recipe:

1. In `CrispASR/src/CMakeLists.txt`, in the *Dart FFI multi-backend linkage* section, add:
   ```cmake
   if (TARGET canary) target_link_libraries(whisper PUBLIC canary) endif()
   ```
2. Add a `#if __has_include("canary.h")` block to `CrispASR/src/crispasr_dart_helpers.cpp`, plus a `case "canary":` arm in `crispasr_session_open_explicit` and `crispasr_session_transcribe`.
3. `cmake --build build --target whisper` and copy both `libwhisper.dylib` + `libcanary.dylib` into the app bundle's `Contents/Frameworks/`.

CrisperWeaver picks up new backends automatically through `CrispasrSession.availableBackends()` — no Dart changes needed. If the user picks a backend the bundled libwhisper wasn't linked with, the load error names exactly which backends ARE available.

## 7. Server modes — built-in vs CrispASR-CLI

**Built-in** (round 5, May 2026): CrisperWeaver ships its own
Dart-side `shelf` HTTP server, toggleable from *Settings → Local
HTTP server*. Bound to `127.0.0.1:8765` by default. Exposes:

- `POST /v1/audio/transcriptions` (multipart upload, OpenAI-shaped
  json/text/srt/vtt response) — routes through the loaded ASR.
- `POST /v1/audio/speech` (JSON in, 24 kHz mono WAV out) — routes
  through `TtsService`.
- `POST /v1/translations` (JSON in, JSON out) — routes through
  `TextTranslationService`.
- `GET /health` (liveness check).

This is the parity path for both desktop and mobile (iOS can't
spawn subprocesses), and avoids loading two copies of every backend
into RAM.

**CLI alternative** (still available for advanced users): CrispASR
ships an HTTP server binary (`examples/cli/crispasr_server.cpp`)
with `POST /inference`, `POST /v1/audio/transcriptions` (OpenAI-
compatible), `POST /load`, `GET /backends`. Desktop builds *could*
bundle the `crispasr` binary and spawn it in server mode for users
who want process isolation or fewer dylibs. We don't bundle it —
the in-app server already covers the use case end-to-end.
