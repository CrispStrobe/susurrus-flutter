# CrisperWeaver

**On-device speech recognition + text-to-speech. No cloud. 24+ model families, one app.**

CrisperWeaver is a cross-platform Flutter app for fully-offline audio transcription and speech synthesis. Drop in a file, paste a URL, or record with the mic — audio never leaves the device. 21+ open-weight ASR families and 4 TTS families are supported through a single unified engine ([CrispASR][crispasr]): Whisper, Parakeet, Canary, Voxtral, Qwen3-ASR, Cohere, Granite, FastConformer-CTC, Canary-CTC, Wav2Vec2, OmniASR, FireRed, Kyutai-STT, GLM-ASR, Moonshine, VibeVoice ASR, MiMo ASR — plus Kokoro / VibeVoice / Qwen3-TTS / Orpheus for synthesis and FireRedPunc for punctuation restoration.

## What you can do

- **Transcribe any audio file** — WAV / MP3 / FLAC decoded on-device, no ffmpeg required.
- **Batch-process multiple files** — drop many onto the window or onto the Batch Queue card, "Transcribe all" drains serially; each run lands in History.
- **Record from the mic** and transcribe live.
- **Paste a URL** to a remote file; CrisperWeaver downloads and processes it.
- **Drag and drop** files onto the transcription screen (desktop) or directly on the batch queue.
- **Receive shared audio** from the OS share sheet (Android / iOS / macOS).
- **Choose your model family and quantisation** — q4_0 / q5_0 / q4_k / q5_k / q6_k / q8_0 variants plus f16 originals. Model picker filters by name + backend; Model Management screen auto-probes HuggingFace to discover every available quant.
- **Download and manage models** from a built-in browser — parallel queue, resume, SHA-1 verify, cancel, delete.
- **Advanced decoding knobs** — translate-to-English (Whisper), beam search, initial-prompt vocabulary bias (huge win for domain audio), audio Q&A prompt for instruct-tuned LLM backends (Voxtral / Qwen3), source + target language pickers for true speech translation.
- **Tune the decoder live** — best-of-N slider (1–10, picks the highest-scoring of N decodes; works on every backend) and decoder temperature slider for sampling-capable backends (canary, cohere, parakeet, moonshine).
- **See live performance numbers** — real-time factor, words per second, wall-clock.
- **Get word-level timestamps** and language auto-detection (via Whisper).
- **Stream transcription** from long-running mic input — partial transcripts appear in the output card while you talk (10 s sliding window / 3 s step).
- **Watch long files transcribe in real time** — chunked Whisper splits >60 s files into 30 s windows and streams segments through as each finishes, instead of waiting until the end.
- **Export** to `.txt`, `.srt`, `.vtt`, or `.json` through the system share sheet.
- **Review history** — every run is persisted as JSON and browseable / re-exportable, with speaker renames preserved across launches.
- **Rename diariser speakers** — tap a speaker chip in the output to override the auto-assigned label ("Speaker 1" → "Alice"); the new name persists in history.
- **See where storage went** — Settings → Storage breakdown lists per-backend disk usage with a one-click "delete all of X" action.
- **Diagnose with logs** — in-app viewer with filter / search / copy / export, optional file sink.
- **Synthesize speech (TTS)** — pick a downloaded TTS model + voice + codec on the *Synthesize* screen, type text, hit *Synthesize*; output plays in-app and saves as WAV.
- **Restore punctuation** — FireRedPunc post-processor toggle in Advanced Options; turns `wav2vec2 / fastconformer-ctc / firered-asr` lowercase output into properly punctuated text.
- **Use CrisperWeaver in English or German** — full i18n scaffold via `flutter_localizations`, every user-facing string covered (guarded by an ARB-consistency test).

## Supported models

One dispatcher (`CrispasrSession`) handles every backend; bundled `libcrispasr` reports at startup which are linked in the current build, and the *Models* screen filter chips group them by kind (`ASR / TTS / Voices / Codecs / Post-processors`). The Model Management screen also probes CrispASR's built-in C-side registry on every open, so any backend the bundled libcrispasr knows about appears even if it isn't hardcoded in the app catalog.

## Building

### Prerequisites

- Flutter 3.38.x (`stable`)
- Xcode + CocoaPods for iOS / macOS
- JDK 17 + Android SDK for Android
- CMake + a C++ toolchain to build `libwhisper` from CrispASR
- Optional: Metal (macOS), CUDA / Vulkan (Linux/Windows), Core ML (iOS), NNAPI (Android)

### Clone the two repos side-by-side

```bash
mkdir crisperweaver && cd crisperweaver
git clone https://github.com/CrispStrobe/CrispASR.git
git clone https://github.com/CrispStrobe/CrisperWeaver.git
```

`pubspec.yaml` refers to the Dart FFI package via `path: ../CrispASR/flutter/crispasr`.

### Desktop one-shot (recommended)

Each desktop platform has an end-to-end script that configures + builds CrispASR's `libwhisper` / `whisper.dll`, runs `flutter build`, and bundles every needed dynamic library next to the runner. They expect the sibling `CrispASR` checkout described above.

```bash
# macOS
./scripts/build_macos.sh release

# Linux
./scripts/build_linux.sh release

# Windows (cmd.exe — picks up pwsh if installed, falls back to powershell.exe)
build_windows.bat release
# or directly:
pwsh -File scripts\build_windows.ps1 release
```

Pass `debug` instead of `release` for a debug build; add `--rebuild-cmake` (or `-RebuildCmake` on Windows) to force a fresh CrispASR cmake configure. Each script's output ends with a path to the runnable bundle / `.app` / `.exe`.

The bundlers can also be invoked standalone (`scripts/bundle_macos_dylibs.sh`, `scripts/bundle_linux_libs.sh`, `scripts/bundle_windows_dlls.ps1`) if you've already built CrispASR and `flutter build <platform>` separately and just want to drop the libs in place.

At runtime, `CrispASREngine` resolves the library by probing platform-specific names — `crispasr.dll` / `libcrispasr.dylib` / `libcrispasr.so` first, then the `whisper`-named alias — under the bundle, the user's CrispASR checkout, system lib dirs, and any user-supplied override path.

### Manual / iterative dev

```bash
cd CrispASR
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DWHISPER_METAL=ON
cmake --build build --parallel --target crispasr

cd ../CrisperWeaver
flutter pub get
flutter run -d macos        # or: linux, windows, android, ios
```

`flutter run` picks up the freshly-built CrispASR shared library directly from `../CrispASR/build/src/` for fast inner-loop work.

---

## Using it

1. **First run**: open *Settings → Manage models* and download the model you want. Default pick is Whisper base (~140 MB, covers 99 languages).
2. **Transcribe a file**: back to the main screen, drop a file or click the picker. Language auto-detects by default.
3. **Record from the mic**: use the recorder card. Stop → transcribe.
4. **Stream from mic** (Whisper): toggle *Stream* in the recorder. Partial text arrives as you speak.
5. **Synthesize speech** (TTS): tap the *Synthesize* icon in the app-bar (next to *Models*). Pick a downloaded TTS model + voice + codec, type text, hit *Synthesize* — output plays in-app and can be saved as WAV via the share sheet.
6. **Export the result**: share-sheet button → pick TXT / SRT / VTT / JSON.
7. **Browse past runs**: *History* in the drawer — everything is persisted as JSON under `<app-docs>/history/`.

Useful Settings:
- **Preferred engine** — CrispASR is the default.
- **Default model / language** — pre-select across new transcriptions.
- **Skip checksum verification** — custom / mirrored GGUFs.
- **Log level + file sink** — `<app-docs>/logs/session.log` for bug reports.

---

## Testing

The default test pass is fast and offline:

```bash
flutter analyze    # 0 issues — see analysis_options.yaml for the strict rule set
flutter test       # 6 tests, ~5 s — widget unit tests + dispatch correctness
```

`test/backend_dispatch_test.dart` always runs the cheap dispatch
checks (every backend appears in `CrispasrSession.availableBackends()`,
opens with bogus paths fail cleanly). The expensive end-to-end synth /
transcribe roundtrips are tagged `slow` and skip themselves silently
unless their `CRISPASR_TEST_<BACKEND>_MODEL` env var points at a
downloaded GGUF. Opt in with:

```bash
M=/path/to/crispasr-models
CRISPASR_TEST_KOKORO_MODEL=$M/kokoro-82m-q8_0.gguf \
CRISPASR_TEST_KOKORO_VOICE=$M/kokoro-voice-af_heart.gguf \
CRISPASR_TEST_QWEN3_TTS_MODEL=$M/qwen3-tts-12hz-0.6b-customvoice-q8_0.gguf \
CRISPASR_TEST_QWEN3_TTS_CODEC=$M/qwen3-tts-tokenizer-12hz.gguf \
CRISPASR_TEST_VIBEVOICE_MODEL=$M/vibevoice-realtime-0.5b-tts-f32-tokenizer.gguf \
CRISPASR_TEST_VIBEVOICE_VOICE=$M/vibevoice-voice-en-Emma_woman.gguf \
CRISPASR_TEST_ORPHEUS_MODEL=$M/orpheus-3b-base-q8_0.gguf \
CRISPASR_TEST_ORPHEUS_CODEC=$M/snac-24khz.gguf \
CRISPASR_TEST_MIMO_ASR_MODEL=$M/mimo/mimo-asr-q4_k.gguf \
CRISPASR_TEST_MIMO_ASR_TOKENIZER=$M/mimo/mimo-tokenizer-q4_k.gguf \
CRISPASR_TEST_WHISPER_MODEL=$M/ggml-tiny.bin \
flutter test --tags slow test/backend_dispatch_test.dart
```

A single sweep takes ~25 min on M1 Metal end-to-end (full sweep —
6 backends including a 3 B Llama and a 4 GB f32 vibevoice). Each
backend skips if its env var isn't set, so partial sweeps are cheap.
Coverage:

```bash
flutter test --coverage      # writes coverage/lcov.info
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/html  # if lcov is installed
```

See `dart_test.yaml` for the tag config and `PLAN.md §5.18` for the
test-suite speed roadmap (the architectural win is a persistent
ggml-metal pipeline cache via `MTLBinaryArchive`, which would cut
the cold-start kernel-JIT cost from minutes to seconds).

---

## CI & releases

- **`ci.yml`** — on push / PR: `flutter analyze` + `flutter test` on Ubuntu and macOS, plus debug `.app` and Linux bundle uploaded as workflow artifacts. Checks out sibling `CrispStrobe/CrispASR` automatically. Slow tests (`--tags slow`) are skipped by default; CI can opt in by setting the `CRISPASR_TEST_*` env vars and adding `--tags slow` to the test command. Analyzer is configured to **error** on `use_build_context_synchronously`, `avoid_print`, `unused_*`, `inference_failure_*`, and `deprecated_member_use` — a regression fails the build instead of silently piling up.
- **`release.yml`** — on a `vX.Y.Z` tag (or manual dispatch): builds and uploads
    - `crisper_weaver-macos.zip` — Metal-enabled `.app`, ad-hoc signed, all 24+ backend dylibs (kokoro / orpheus / mimo-asr included as of CrispASR `ba7d6ed`) bundled.
    - `crisper_weaver-linux-x64.tar.gz` — GTK-3 desktop bundle with all backend `.so`'s.
    - `crisper_weaver-android-arm64.apk` — real ASR. CrispASR cross-built via `build-android.sh --abi arm64-v8a`; `libwhisper.so` and sibling backend `.so`'s dropped into `jniLibs/arm64-v8a/`.
    - `crisper_weaver-ios-unsigned.ipa` — sideload-compatible (see below).

Both workflows honour `CRISPASR_REPO` / `CRISPASR_REF` env vars at the top of each file, in case you maintain a fork of CrispASR.

### Sideloading iOS

We don't pay for the Apple Developer Program yet, so the iOS IPA in releases is **unsigned**. To install it on your own device, use a sideload service:

- **[SideStore](https://sidestore.io/)** — iOS app installer that uses your own Apple ID for signing (free: 7-day re-sign; paid ADP: 1-year). Self-hosted via StosVPN or pair-with-computer.
- **[AltStore](https://altstore.io/)** — the original self-sign flow; requires a desktop-side companion (AltServer).
- **[Feather](https://github.com/khcrysalis/Feather)** — open-source alternative.

All three accept the `.ipa` directly: download `crisper_weaver-ios-unsigned.ipa` from the release page, open in SideStore (Files → share to SideStore), tap Install. The free-tier 7-day limit means you'll need to re-sign weekly unless you also have a paid Apple Developer account.

---

## Roadmap

The short version:

- CoreML acceleration for Whisper on iOS/macOS (enable `WHISPER_USE_COREML` inside CrispASR, ship the paired `.mlmodelc` next to the `.bin`).
- Swap the MFCC/k-means diarization stopgap for the shared-lib `crispasr_diarize_segments_abi` introduced in CrispASR v0.4.5 (pyannote GGUF + energy/xcorr/vad-turns in one call).
- Wire the shared `crispasr_detect_language_pcm` (v0.4.6) for auto-language on backends that lack native LID.
- Wire `crispasr_align_words_abi` (v0.4.7) to give word-level timestamps to LLM-based backends (qwen3 / voxtral / granite) that don't emit them natively.
- Expose more CrispASR power-user knobs in the UI: beam search / best-of-N, temperature, source/target languages for translation backends, audio Q&A mode, streaming UI (see PLAN.md §5.8). VAD and `initialPrompt` already shipped in v0.1.7.
- Windows CI job (build script + DLL bundler shipped — `scripts/build_windows.ps1`; CI workflow still TODO).
- Android CI: cross-build `libwhisper.so` + sibling backends, drop into `jniLibs/`, ship a real-ASR APK.
- iOS `pod install` + device-build CI verification.
- Finish i18n migration for widgets + older Settings strings.
- Backend-specific UX (source/target language UI for Canary, Voxtral audio Q&A mode, Granite `--ask` flag, etc.).
